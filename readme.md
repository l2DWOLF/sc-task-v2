# SC - Triangle Task Final Version

This version is for learning purposes only and was made past the original deadline for the task, 

## Notes

- Extra functionality: generate random triangle.
- Extra features: generate css triangle. 
- Improvements: minor encapsulation & styling. 

## Conclusion

### New Math functions learned: 
- Math.hypot > distance between two points in 2D space. [Pythagorean theorem, returns Euclidean distance].
- Math.acos > find angles in a triangle from side lengths. (trigonometry, law of cosines, returns radians). 
- Math.atan2 > compute angles between x-axis and vector in radians (analytic geometry, returns radians). 
- Math.cos > cosine of an angle (trigonometry, returns radians).
- Math.sin > sine of an angle (trigonometry, returns radians).
- Math.PI > use case - convert radians to degrees.

### JS vs CSS triangles: 
-For this project, I would choose using js to create the triangles for more precise control and full compatibility as CSS clip path isn't fully  supported across all browsers and offers less flexibility - labeling and positioning would require additional overhead.
